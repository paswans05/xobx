# Roadmap 🗺️

The future of XOBX is focused on reducing latency, improving customization, and expanding accessibility. Here is our plan for upcoming features.

## 🟢 Phase 1: Customization (Short Term)

- **Custom Key Mapping**: A UI in the Windows Host to change which keyboard keys each controller button maps to.
- **Multiple Layouts**: More presets for Specific genres (FPS, Racing, Fighting).
- **Haptic Patterns**: Different vibration visualizations for different types of buttons.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Improved theme switching for the web controller.

## 🟡 Phase 2: Performance & Connectivity (Mid Term)

- **Cloud Relay (X-Link Service)**: Connect your phone to your PC even when not on the same Wi-Fi (using a secure relay server).
- **UDP Implementation**: Explore WebRTC/UDP for even lower latency compared to WebSockets.
- **Multicast DNS (mDNS)**: Automatic discovery of the host PC so users don't have to type IP addresses manually.

## 🟠 Phase 3: Platform Expansion (Long Term)

- **Multi-Controller Support**: Use multiple phones as separate players on the same PC.
- **Native Wrappers (PWA+)**: Improved "Add to Home Screen" experience with better fullscreen and wake-lock support.
- **Android/iOS Apps**: Optional native apps for even better performance and access to system-level haptics (real vibration).
- **Mac/Linux Support**: Porting the Windows host bridge to other desktop operating systems.
